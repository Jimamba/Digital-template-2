<h2>CatFace vs. Mc.Derp</h2>
<ul>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
A two player face-off, where players collect mana stars to fuel their super(and only)
dance move summon.
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
I want my players to enjoy the game's odd art and gameplay. Ultimately, I want them to
have fun competing against each other in a short match.
</li>

<li><strong>Genre:</strong>
Fighter-Platformer.
</li>

<li><strong>Game play:</strong>
There are two player characters that initially start out on the screen. On the lower left is
CatFace and on the lower right is Mc.Derp. Each player can move left,right, jump, and dance.
For CatFace, these inputs are the arrow keys and M. For Mc.Derp, these inputs are W,A,D, and
R. Dancing on it's own does nothing, but mana stars that fall from the sky when colliding with
the players can refuel their mana by 10. Once their mana is filled to 100, their dance unleashes
a large area-of-effect move that stays until the enemy is hit by it. The move's location is
randomized, but it's always on the ground level. Therefore players also have the option of
sticking to the above platforms. As a final note, the attack does 25 damage to the other player
and resets the mana gauge for its player back to 0.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype goal:</strong>
Single-move fighting game that has a random area of effect.
</li>

<li><strong>Features:</strong>
There is only one move for each character. Each move is an area of effect attack, that is
randomly generated and deals 25 damage. Other than that it has almost basic platforming,
and you collect mana stars to fuel your mana. Once your move is used, your mana goes back to
0.
</li>

<li><strong>Setting/Premise:</strong>
CatFace and Mc.Derp are duking it out to see who can rule as Meme Supreme.
</li>

<li><strong>Story:</strong>
You get to take part in one of the most extreme battles known to mankind. CatFace vs. Mc.Derp.
The stupidity of the whole situation is almost too much to comprehend, but you manage to place
your hand on the keyboard in your quest to defeat your foe.
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
My target audience is the best kind of people, or to answer the question more seriously, people
with a good sense of humor.
</li>

<li><strong>Play time:</strong>
Relatively short, but it can go longer depending on whether or not the players are goofing off.
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
The most effective strategy would be to immediately race to get 100 mana stars and use them ASAP.
Then if the other player has mana stars, racing to the top platforms would be the safest option.
